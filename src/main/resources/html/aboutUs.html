              means Caleb hasn’t had much of a chance to explore Australia
              outside Melbourne and its surrounds. While helping his daughter
              research some homework one day, he was shocked to learn of the
              disparity in indigenous and non-indigenous life expectancy rates.
              Caleb wishes to find more information and potentially ways in
              which he could contribute to positive change.
