Updated Team_Members & User_Personas in ERD to have Primary Keys
Removed LGA from some attributes in LGA table (is redundant)
Changed LGA_Code to LGA.Code to lessen ambiguous names

The data is bad, the tables do not match up in numbers, this had to be accounted for in the percentages.

We had to change the tables multiple times to get something that was more viewable, our tables were easy to query initially but harder to display to be usable.

We're using views to query the database, this is nice as it cleans up java code and modifications can easily be made to the view in sqlite if needed.

RANKING METRIC!! MY SAVIOUR! (Lots of ridiculous queries were made but all that was needed was a ranking metric case clause). Actually no wait this isn't true I'm gna cry.
